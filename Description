A common approach to outlier detection in time series is to use prediction models. These approaches define a way of building a prediction model, and then compute an “outlier
score” for each point in the time series according to its deviation from the predicted value. 

As part of this project we are creating synthetic time series which we would be using to estimate parameters of AR models.

Once estimated, model will be fitted and predicted using inbuilt package  'statsmodels.tsa.ar_model'. 

Noise was added to the data. Corrupted data was re-estimated using AR model and predicted.

Score (MSE) was used to measure difference between actual and predicted data points

This project highlights how well AR model detects outlier.
